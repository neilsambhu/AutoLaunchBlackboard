# AutoLaunchBlackboard
Spring 2022 Software Engineering TAs:

**Use the LaunchBlackboard.bat ("the script") file to automate which Blackboard link opens based on the day of the week.**
1. Turn on hidden file extensions in Windows (https://knowledge.autodesk.com/search-result/caas/sfdcarticles/sfdcarticles/How-to-enable-hidden-file-extensions-in-Windows.html).
2. Downloading the script as a \*.bat file (https://stackoverflow.com/a/13593430) to your desktop.
3. Double click the \*.bat file. 
4. Enter your name.
5. Click "Join Session".

To avoid steps 4-5, we will need 
6. Python to click buttons in the browser based on pixel location or
7. Permanent, non-guest, Blackboard links.
